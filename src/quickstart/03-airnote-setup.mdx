## Airnote Setup

To set up your Airnote and start capturing air quality readings,
follow the steps below.

<Note>

**Don't scan that QR Code yet!**

Before you can configure the Airnote via the included
QR Code, the device needs to make its first
connection to the cloud. If you scan the code before
your Airnote is online, you'll see an
error message on the airnote.live configuration page for your device.

</Note>

### Turn It On

To give the Airnote a few minutes to find a cell tower and make its
first connection to the [Notehub.io](https://notehub.io) cloud service,
you'll next want to turn it on. Find the black slide switch at the base of
the device between the two screws and turn on your Airnote.

Once you've flipped the switch, look at the LCD screen on the back.

If you
see anything on the screen, that means the device has started its self-test
sequence, and you're ready for the next step.

<Note>

Your Airnote should have enough charge out of the box to function and fully charge its
battery using the onboard solar panel. If, however, your Airnote needs a manual charge at
any time, you can do so with a micro USB cable. [See manual charging instructions.](/quickstart#how-can-i-manually-charge-my-airnote)

</Note>

### Mount It

Once the device is charged and reassembled, find
a place to mount it. For best performance, we recommend mounting
the Airnote on the outside of an exterior window that
gets a lot of sunlight. Using a window allows you to see real-time air
quality readings on the included LCD display.

If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, use a south-facing window, if possible.
If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, use a north-facing window.

Separate four of the included velcro Command Strips, and join the velcro
sides together to make two pairs of strips. Remove the backing tape off of
one side of each pair and place one above and one below the LCD screen on
the back of the device. This is the side that you will want to be
visible through a window.

Next, remove the backing tape from the still exposed sides of the
Command Strips and secure it to your preferred location. We've provided eight
strips in total just in case you ever need to reposition the device.

<Note>

**The Airnote is not intended to be set directly on top of a solid surface!**

To ensure that the Airnote has proper airflow for heat dissipation and sensor accuracy,
the device includes a vented baseplate. This should not be obstructed and as such, we
do not suggest placing the airnote on a table, railing or other non-porous surface.

</Note>

### Watch the Self-Test And See Your First Reading

Once the Airnote is powered on, it begins a self-test sequence that is
detailed in the [Airnote Datasheet](https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-datasheet/#self-testing-sequence).
This sequence may take a few minutes depending on the strength of cellular
service in your area. Once completed, the screen on your device displays the
current PM2.5 reading in micrograms per cubic meter air (or Âµg/m3), which you
can customize in the next step.

### Scan the QR Code and Customize Your Airnote

Now, you're ready to customize your device. Open a QR code reader on
your mobile device and scan the QR code on the back of the Airnote, just
below the LCD screen.

![image of a person scanning the Airnote QR code with a phone](images/guides/airnote/scan.png)

The code on each Airnote is unique to the device and directs you to
a personalized landing page here on [airnote.live](/). From this
site you can update device settings, set your contact information, and view
charts and graphs for your Airnote. All of the settings and contact information on this
site is optional.

<Note>

If you see the **Unable to Fetch Device Details** error message on the
screen after you scan the QR code, that means your Airnote hasn't
yet connected to the cloud. Give the device a few minutes to make its first
cellular connection and refresh the page to try again.

</Note>

The device settings section allows you to assign a name to the device, set how
often the Airnote should sample readings from its onboard sensors, and which
sensor value (like temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) to display on the
built-in screen.

![Image of the device settings section of the Airnote landing page](images/guides/airnote/devicesettings.png)

The owner settings section allows you to share your contact information
with other members of the global Safecast network. Again, this information
is optional.

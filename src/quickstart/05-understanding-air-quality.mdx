## Understanding Air Quality

Air quality is the result of several factors. The single largest contributing
factor is particulate matter, or PM. According to the EPA, "PM stands for
particulate matter (also called particle pollution): the term for a mixture of
solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air."

The Airnote samples and reports three different levels of particulate matter,
PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>1.0</sub>.

### PM<sub>10</sub>

Inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10
micrometers and smaller. PM<sub>10</sub> is a mixture of materials that can
include smoke, soot, dust, salt, acids, and metals. Particulate matter also
forms when gases emitted from motor vehicles and industrial machinery undergo chemical
reactions in the atmosphere.

### PM<sub>2.5</sub>

Fine inhalable particles, with diameters 2.5 micrometers and
smaller. Fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is an air pollutant that is
a concern for people's health when levels in air are high. PM<sub>2.5</sub> are
tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear
hazy when levels are elevated. Outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels are most likely
to be elevated on days with little or no wind or air mixing.

### PM<sub>1.0</sub>

Described as extremely fine particulate matter, PM<sub>1.0</sub> is much less
frequently talked about, as there is little available data. However, it is
believed to have even more significant health impacts than PM<sub>2.5</sub> and
PM<sub>10</sub>. However, scientists still aren't clear about the health
implications of these particles.

### EPA Standards (December 14th, 2012)

|      PM      | Safe Levels (&micro;g/m&sup3;) |
| :----------: | :----------------------------: |
| 1.0 (24-hrs) |               --               |
| 1.0 (Annual) |               --               |
| 2.5 (24-hrs) |               35               |
| 2.5 (Annual) |               12               |
| 10 (24-hrs)  |              150               |
| 10 (Annual)  |              50\*              |

> _\* Originally set at 50 &micro;g/m&sup3;, the annual PM10 standard was revoked
> because of a lack of evidence establishing a link between long-term exposure to
> coarse particles and health problems._

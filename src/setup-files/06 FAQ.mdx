### How can I manually charge my Airnote?

Your Airnote should have enough charge out of the box to function and
fully charge the battery using the onboard solar panel. If, however, your
Airnote needs a manual charge, you can do so with a Micro USB cable.

Remove the rear bottom panel from the Airnote and plug
a Micro USB cable into the Micro USB port as shown in the image below.

If the Airnote is off when you plug it in, you won't see any visual indication
that the device is charging, even though it is. If the device has been switched
on, the LCD display will update to indicate that the device is charging.
When the plus (+) sign on the display disappears, the Airnote is charged and
ready to mount.

Once the battery has charged, place the bottom panel back
on the Airnote and secure the panel with the two included
Phillips screws.

### How do I know my Airnote is charging?

If the Airnote is off when plugged into USB, you won't see any visual indication
that the device is charging, even though it is. If the device is on, you
can use the built-in LCD panel to monitor the charging process.

When the Airnote is plugged-in via USB, place it on a flat surface with the
LCD screen facing up. The display will update to read "USb" with a
lowercase "b" and plus (+) sign. The plus sign will disappear when the
battery is full.

### Can I check the current voltage of my Airnote?

Yes. Remove the Airnote from its mounted location and place it on a flat surface
with the solar charging panel facing down.

When the Airnote's built-in accelerometer detects this orientation (which might take
several seconds), the built-in display will update to indicate the current voltage of
the device's battery. Anything over 4 volts indicates the battery is full.

### Can I use the Airnote indoors?

The Airnote is not rated for indoor use. We recommend mounting the
device only in outdoor settings.

### How can I mount the Airnote?

Use the Command Strips included with your Airnote and affix them
to the back using the instructions [here](https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/#mount-it).

### The built-in screen on the Airnote is updating with a lot of information once I power it on. What does all of this mean?

When powered on, the Airnote performs a self-test sequence before it
enters normal operation. This self-test sequence is detailed in the
[Airnote Datasheet](https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-datasheet/).

### Why is my Airnote showing "LOBAT"?

If you see this on the LCD screen, it means the battery is low. Move the Airnote
to a location with more sunlight, or charge the device over USB.

### Why is my Airnote showing the letters "CL"?

After the Airnote runs through its self-test sequence, it attempts to connect to
a cellular tower to obtain the time. Until it obtains the time, "CL" is
displayed to indicate that the Airnote is waiting for clock time in order to
begin capturing air quality readings.

### Why is my Airnote flashing a plus sign ("+")?

The plus sign indicates that the Airnote is performing a network operation. A
flashing plus sign indicates that cellular or GPS is on, and a fast-flash means
that the Airnote is connected to the cloud and is syncing.

### Why is my airnote displaying a colon character (":") on the screen?

If you see this on the screen, it means that the Airnote couldn't find a
cellular tower the last time it tried to sync. Move the device to another
location and try again.

### Do I need to update the Airnote firmware or activate the device?

No. The Airnote is a pre-configured cellular-powered device. You don't need
to do anything to activate it other than turning it on, and there's no need
to update the firmware on the device in order to use it.

### What air quality sensors does the Airnote use?

For details about the onboard sensors, see
the [Airnote Datasheet](https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-datasheet/).

### In which countries can the Airnote operate?

The Airnote's built-in cellular connection works in over 135 countries. For
the complete list, see the [Notecard datasheet](https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/notecard-datasheet/note-nbgl-500/#cellular-service).

### What does the value in the Serial Number field represent?

The Airnote is populated with a unique serial number string during activation.
The string is auto-generated using three random words, separated by hyphens.

### Why does the LCD screen turn off?

The Airnote's LCD screen shuts off if voltage is too low. Make sure to position
your Airnote in a location that receives enough sunlight to charge the device,
or [manually charge your Airnote](https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/#how-can-i-manually-charge-my-airnote).

### Why don't I see data on the dashboard at the same rate data is collected?

By default the Airnote collects data every 30 minutes, and you can [configure that
rate on your device's dashboard](https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/#scan-the-qr-code-and-customize-your-airnote).

The Airnote transmits collected data every 60 minutes, however the transmission
rate can vary based on the device's battery level. If your device is not
transmitting data, you can try [checking its current voltage](#can-i-check-the-current-voltage-of-my-airnote),
and [manually charging if necessary](https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/#how-can-i-manually-charge-my-airnote).

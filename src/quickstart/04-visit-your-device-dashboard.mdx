## Visit Your Device Dashboard

Every Airnote has a dashboard that displays the device's air quality and environmental
readings over time. You can access the your dashboard by visiting
`https://airnote.live/[Your_DeviceUID]/dashboard`
(e.g. `https://airnote.live/dev:12345678901234/dashboard`).

The easiest way to access this URL is by scanning the QR code on your Airnote,
and then clicking the **View your device's dashboard** button.

The Airnote dashboard displays current air quality information, as well as historical readings
over the past seven days.

From the Airnote dashboard, you can also get a link to the [Notehub.io](https://notehub.io)
Events view for your device, and browse other devices in the public Airnote project.
